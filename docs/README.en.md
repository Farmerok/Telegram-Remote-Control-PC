## 📝 Introduction

Welcome to **PCGuardControl**! This powerful bot allows you to remotely control your computer using simple Telegram commands, making your work more convenient and efficient.

The script supports both a single administrator and multiple administrators. For example, if you are using a family computer, you can grant access to your loved ones.

The script regularly receives free updates. As long as I have the ability and desire, I will maintain its functionality.
